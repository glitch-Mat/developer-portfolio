Developer Portfolio - VIDUSHI SINGH

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This repository serves as the central hub for showcasing my technical skills, completed projects, and journey in web development.

Objective
My goal is to transition from a student of engineering fundamentals to a highly capable full-stack developer, specializing in the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This portfolio acts as my verifiable proof of skill.
